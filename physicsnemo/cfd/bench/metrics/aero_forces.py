    """
    Computes force coefficients for a given mesh. Output includes the pressure and skin
    friction components. Can be used to compute lift and drag.
    For drag, use the `force_direction` as the direction of the motion,
    e.g. [1, 0, 0] for flow in x direction.
    For lift, use the `force_direction` as the direction perpendicular to the motion,
    e.g. [0, 1, 0] for flow in x direction and weight in y direction.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    normals: np.ndarray
        The surface normals on cells of the mesh
    area: np.ndarray
        The surface areas of each cell
    coeff: float
        Reciprocal of dynamic pressure times the frontal area, i.e. 2/(A * rho * U^2)
    p: np.ndarray
        Pressure distribution on the mesh (on each cell)
    wss: np.ndarray
        Wall shear stress distribution on the mesh (on each cell)
    force_direction: np.ndarray
        Direction to compute the force, default is np.array([1, 0, 0])

    Returns:
    --------
    c_total: float
        Computed total force coefficient
    c_p: float
        Computed pressure force coefficient
    c_f: float
        Computed skin friction coefficient

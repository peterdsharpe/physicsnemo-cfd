# DoMINO Sensitivity Analysis for Aerodynamic Design

This workflow demonstrates how to compute and visualize geometry sensitivities
for external aerodynamics using a pre-trained DoMINO surrogate. It provides:

- **Sensitivity visualization**: surface-normal sensitivity maps that highlight
  where adding or removing material reduces drag
- **Post-processing**: Laplacian smoothing and normal projection for physically
  meaningful fields
- **Validation**: finite-difference gradient checking against adjoint/autograd
  gradients
- **Batching and multi-GPU**: efficient inference for large meshes

## What this computes

Given a surface mesh and flow conditions, the pipeline predicts surface pressure
and wall shear stress and computes gradients of total drag with respect to the
mesh coordinates. The returned sensitivity vectors indicate the direction to
move each surface element to reduce drag.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-capable GPU
- Packages: in addition to the base packages required by PhysicsNeMo-CFD,
  install the extras in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-build-isolation
```

You also need a pre-trained DoMINO checkpoint, which is not included in this
repository. Replace `DoMINO.0.41.pt` with your own model (see the [DoMINO
training
example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/tree/main/examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/domino)).

## Quick start

Open `main.ipynb` and run all cells. It covers:

- Config and distributed setup (Hydra + `DistributedManager`)
- Loading a geometry with PyVista
- Running `DoMINOInference` to get results and sensitivities
- Post-processing to surface-normal and smoothed fields
- Visualization and warping for intuition

## API

### DoMINOInference

```python
results = DoMINOInference(
    cfg=cfg,                     # DictConfig; see conf/config.yaml
    model_checkpoint_path="./DoMINO.0.41.pt",  # or your checkpoint path
    dist=DistributedManager(),   # optional; single-GPU if omitted
)(
    mesh=mesh,                 # pv.PolyData surface mesh
    stream_velocity=38.889,    # m/s
    stencil_size=7,            # surface neighborhood size
    air_density=1.205,         # kg/m^3
    verbose=True,              # show batch progress
)
```

Returns a `dict[str, np.ndarray]` with shapes referenced to surface cells unless
noted:

- `geometry_coordinates`: (n_points, 3) sampled coordinates used internally
- `geometry_sensitivity`: (n_faces, 3) raw sensitivity vectors d(-drag)/dX
- `pred_surf_pressure`: (n_faces,) surface pressure [Pa]
- `pred_surf_wall_shear_stress`: (n_faces, 3) wall shear [Pa]
- `aerodynamic_force`: (3,) [Fx, Fy, Fz] [N]

Notes:

- The gradient is of -drag, so vectors point in the direction that reduces drag
  when the surface moves along them.
- Batching is handled internally. If you see OOM, reduce neighborhood size or
  decimate the mesh.

### Post-processing

```python
processed = DoMINOInference.postprocess_point_sensitivities(
    results=results,
    mesh=mesh,                  # pv.PolyData with normals
    n_laplacian_iters=20,
)
```

Adds commonly used sensitivity fields (keys and shapes):

- `raw_sensitivity_cells`: (n_faces, 3) raw sensitivity vectors d(-drag)/dX
- `raw_sensitivity_normal_cells`: (n_faces,) projection onto cell normals
- `smooth_sensitivity_point`: (n_points, 3) smoothed vector field on points
- `smooth_sensitivity_normal_point`: (n_points,) smoothed scalar normal
  component on points
- `smooth_sensitivity_cell`: (n_faces, 3) point-smoothed field transferred to
  cells
- `smooth_sensitivity_normal_cell`: (n_faces,) point-smoothed scalar transferred
  to cells

Smoothing uses `utilities/mesh_postprocessing.py` (CSR adjacency and
Numba-accelerated Laplacian averaging on the 1-ring). Increase
`n_laplacian_iters` for stronger smoothing.

## Configuration

`conf/config.yaml` defines the domain, variables, and model hyperparameters.
Important entries:

- `data.bounding_box` and `data.bounding_box_surface`: min/max corners for
  volume and surface sampling. Should be consistent with training data bounds.
- `variables.surface.solution` and `variables.volume.solution`: names and types
  (scalar/vector) that determine output channels.
- `model.interp_res`, `model.num_surface_neighbors`, and related geometry
  extraction parameters control memory/performance.

The notebooks initialize Hydra like this:

```python
with hydra.initialize(version_base="1.3", config_path="./conf"):
    cfg = hydra.compose(config_name="config")
```

## Gradient checking (finite differences)

See `gradient_checking.ipynb` for a full walk-through. Outline:

1. Run baseline inference on a decimated mesh for speed:
   `geometries/drivaer_1_single_solid_decimated3.stl`.
2. Post-process to obtain raw and smoothed sensitivity fields.
3. Define `get_drag(epsilon, sensitivities)` that perturbs point coordinates by
   `epsilon * sensitivities` and re-evaluates drag.
4. Sweep symmetric `epsilon` values over several orders of magnitude and compute
   drag deltas for both raw and smoothed fields.
5. Plot drag change vs. epsilon on symlog axes and compare against the adjoint
   (autograd) linear prediction.

Tips:

- This is computationally heavy (many forward evaluations). Use the decimated
  mesh and consider limiting the epsilon set for quick checks.
- Smoothed normal sensitivities often produce more stable finite-difference
  behavior.

## Visualization

The notebooks use PyVista to visualize scalar fields like
`smooth_sensitivity_normal_cell`:

```python
mesh.plot(
    scalars="smooth_sensitivity_normal_cell",
    cmap="RdBu_r",
    jupyter_backend="static",
    cpos=[-1, -1, 1],
    clim=(-1, 1),
)
```

Warping for intuition (purely illustrative):

```python
warped = mesh.warp_by_scalar("smooth_sensitivity_normal_point", factor=0.05)
warped.plot(scalars="smooth_sensitivity_normal_cell", cmap="RdBu_r")
```

## Notes and guidance

- Sensitivities are valid for small, smooth deformations. Large warps are for
  visualization only.
- Projection to surface normals removes tangential components that should not
  affect the PDE solution.
- For multi-GPU, `DistributedManager` is initialized automatically; if a single
  process is detected, it runs in single-GPU/CPU mode.
- If you trained your own model, update the checkpoint path and ensure config
  bounds match your training domain.

### Limitations and model smoothness (C1 continuity)

Design sensitivities assume the surrogate is at least C1 (once continuously
differentiable) with respect to inputs that affect geometry and flow conditions.
If the model is not sufficiently smooth, gradients can be noisy, unstable, or
misleading.

Actionable configuration guidance:

- **Activation functions**: Prefer smooth choices with continuous derivatives,
  such as SiLU/Swish, GELU, or Softplus (with beta > 1 for sharper yet smooth
  transitions). Avoid ReLU/LeakyReLU/PReLU if you require derivative continuity
  at zero; those are only piecewise linear and not C1.
- **Neighborhood/aggregation**: Hard top-k selections and max pooling are
  non-differentiable at selection boundaries. Keep the stencil fixed during
  sensitivity evaluation and restrict deformations to be small. When possible,
  prefer smooth, density-weighted aggregations (e.g., softmax-weighted sums,
  averages) over hard maxima.
- **Geometry encodings**: Use continuous encodings (e.g., signed distance fields
  and smooth positional transforms). Avoid non-smooth ops like `abs`, `floor`,
  or conditional kinks in geometry pipelines. Fourier features are smooth.
- **Data preprocessing**: Neighborhood graph construction (e.g., k-NN) is a
  discrete operation. Gradients are valid locally under fixed connectivity, but
  can jump when connectivity changes. Keep `stencil_size` fixed and geometry
  perturbations small for gradient checks and early-stage optimization.
- **Post-processing**: The Laplacian smoothing and normal projection are for
  interpretation. They are not in the gradient path used to compute
  `geometry_sensitivity`. Use them to regularize updates if you couple
  sensitivities to a design loop.

In short: choose smooth activations, avoid hard discontinuities in
pre-processing/post-processing, and keep perturbations small so that the piecewise-smooth
assumptions remain valid.

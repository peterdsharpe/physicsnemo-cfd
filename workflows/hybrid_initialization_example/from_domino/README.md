# Metadata and DoMINO-NIM Assets for Hybrid Initialization Example

In addition to the files here, you will also need a `predicted_flow.vtu` file,
which is the output from the DoMINO NIM. This file is ~40 GB, and hence is not
included in this repository. The `prepare_domino_assets.py` script will
interface with the DoMINO NIM to generate the `predicted_flow.vtu` file.
